# AI-Wordle-Solver

An AI that attempts to solve Wordle problems. The agent uses a knowledge-based AI and inference to choose words based on the occurances of the letters they contain and how much new knowledge they provide to the agent. To see method of how I created this AI, and the reasoning behind how I designed it, please go to the Wiki.
